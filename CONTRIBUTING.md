1. How to Contribute

We (the community) appreciate any help! Here are some ways you can contribute:

    Code: Add new features, fix bugs, or improve existing code.
    Documentation: Help make our documentation better. This can be anything from fixing typos to writing helpful guides.
    Testing: Try out the model and let us know if you find any bugs or ways to make it better.
    Ethical Discussions: Share your thoughts on how we can make AI more ethical and fair.
    Promotion: Spread the word about the project, and invite others to join our community.

2. Setting Up the Project

Before you can contribute, you’ll need to set up the project on your computer. Here’s how:

    Fork the Repository:
        Go to the GitHub repository and click the "Fork" button. This creates your own copy of the project.

    Clone Your Fork:
        After forking, open your terminal (or command prompt), and type the following:

        git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/NineBoxCognitionModel.git
        cd NineBoxCognitionModel

        Replace YourUsername with your GitHub username. This will download the project files to your computer.

3. Branching Strategy

We use branches to keep things organized. Here's what you need to know:

    Main branch: This is where the stable version of the project lives. You should not push directly to this branch.
    Feature branches: Create a new branch for any changes you want to make. For example, if you're working on a bug fix, name your branch something like bugfix/fix-issue123.

4. Pull Request Process

Once you’re done with your changes, follow these steps:

    Commit your changes:
    Save your changes to your branch using git commit.

    Push your branch:
    Upload your branch to your GitHub repository using:

    git push origin your-branch-name

    Create a Pull Request (PR):
        Go to your GitHub repository, and you'll see an option to "Compare & pull request."
        Write a clear description of what you changed and why.
        Submit the pull request to the main repository.

5. Code and Documentation Standards

We want our code to be clean and easy to understand. Please follow these rules:

    Code Style: Follow a consistent coding style. If you're unsure, look at how the existing code is written.
    Documentation: Make sure to write clear comments and update any related documentation.
    Keep it simple: Aim to make changes as simple and easy to understand as possible.

6. Ethical Considerations

When contributing to the Nine Box Cognition Model, please consider the ethical implications of your work. Ensure that your contributions:

    Align with the ethical framework of the project.
    Promote fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in AI.

7. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or something that could be improved, please report it! Here’s how:

    Go to the Issues page.
    Click “New Issue” and describe the problem.
    If possible, provide steps to reproduce the issue.
