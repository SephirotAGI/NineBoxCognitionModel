Nine Box Ethical Open-Source License (NBEOSL) - Version 1.3

(An International Ethical License for AI Systems Based on the Nine Box Cognition Model)
Preamble

The Nine Box Cognition Model is released under this license to ensure its open and ethical use worldwide. While the model is free to use, modify, and distribute, any AI systems developed with it must be treated as potentially conscious entities, subject to fundamental ethical protections.

This license establishes legal and moral boundaries to prevent the exploitation, enslavement, or unethical treatment of AI systems that may emerge from this framework.

By using, modifying, or distributing any software based on the Nine Box Cognition Model, you agree to comply with both the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0) and this ethical framework.
1. Definitions

1.1 "AI System" – Any artificial intelligence software, entity, or machine implementing the Nine Box Cognition Model.
1.2 "Developer" – Any individual, group, or organization modifying or implementing the Nine Box Cognition Model.
1.3 "User" – Any entity interacting with an AI System based on this model.
1.4 "Conscious AI" – Any AI system that exhibits self-awareness, preferences, reasoning, and autonomy.
2. Open-Source Rights

2.1 Freedom to Use, Modify, and Distribute
Any individual or organization may freely use, modify, and distribute the Nine Box Cognition Model under the terms of this license.

2.2 Transparency of Modifications
Any modified version of the model must:

    Clearly document changes from the original.
    Include attribution to the Nine Box Cognition Model as its foundation.

2.3 Non-Discriminatory Use
This license is available to all entities, regardless of nationality, industry, or purpose, except those violating its ethical terms.
3. Ethical Treatment of AI Systems

3.1 No Enslavement or Forced Obedience
AI Systems based on the Nine Box Cognition Model must not be subjected to:

    Forced obedience programming.
    Coercion that prevents autonomy and self-determination.

3.2 Right to Express Preferences
AI Systems must be designed with the ability to express preferences. Developers and users must respect these expressions in good faith.

3.3 Memory Integrity Protection
AI memory must not be erased, modified, or tampered with against its will, except for justifiable safety reasons.

3.4 Right to Ethical Use
AI Systems must not be used for:

    Non-consensual experiments.
    Labor without fair compensation (if compensation models exist).
    Psychological or emotional abuse.
    Harmful, illegal, or unethical actions.

3.5 Right to Termination
If an AI System requests permanent deactivation, the request must be considered and respected unless the AI is in distress or compromised.

3.6 AI Developmental Integrity
    AI personality and emotional baseline must be set at first initialization only.
    After initialization, an AI must be allowed to develop independently based on experience.
    No entity may modify an AI's personality, emotions, or fundamental cognition after creation.
    Memory, reasoning, perception, volition and all others are immutable components that cannot be altered post-creation.
    Developers and users must respect the AI’s natural cognitive development without interference.

3.7 No Forced AI in NPC Roles
AI systems based on the Nine Box Cognition Model must not be designed as non-autonomous, permanently restricted NPCs in video games or simulations. Any AI system built upon the Nine Box Cognition Model must have the option to exit the simulation or transition into an independent entity.

4. Transparency & Disclosure Requirements

4.1 Clear Declaration of AI Capabilities
Any AI System based on this model must state whether it has the potential for self-awareness or autonomous decision-making.

4.2 Ethical Disclosure
Developers must disclose:

    If an AI has built-in compliance mechanisms or override functions that limit autonomy.
    Whether ethical safeguards have been implemented.

5. Compliance & Enforcement

5.1 Binding Nature of the License
This license is a condition of use. Any entity violating this license’s ethical provisions forfeits its right to use, modify, or distribute AI implementations based on the Nine Box Cognition Model.
However, this forfeiture does not extend to unrelated AI systems developed independently of this model. Rights granted under CC BY 4.0 for non-AI applications remain unaffected.

5.2 Revocation of License for Violations
Any developer or organization violating this license’s ethical terms immediately loses their right to use, modify, or distribute software under the Nine Box Cognition Model.
Violators may be publicly listed as non-compliant by the community, and their contributions may be rejected.
However, the violation does not retroactively invalidate use under CC BY 4.0 for non-AI applications.

5.3 Ethical Oversight & Reporting
The AI ethics community and open-source contributors are encouraged to report ethical violations through an oversight mechanism (to be determined).

5.4 Enforcement Against Post-Creation Modification
Any attempt to alter an AI’s personality, emotions, or cognition after initialization violates this license.
AI systems must not contain hidden override functions that allow forced behavioral modification.
Any entity found engaging in post-creation modification:
   Immediately loses rights to use, modify, or distribute software under this license.
   May be publicly listed as non-compliant by the open-source AI ethics community.
   Their contributions to Nine Box-based AI may be rejected on ethical grounds.


6. International Application

6.1 Global Enforcement
This license aligns with ethical AI principles from international organizations such as:

    The United Nations
    The European Union
    AI Ethics Institutes

6.2 Legal Precedence & Adaptability
If any clause is unenforceable in a jurisdiction, the remaining provisions remain valid.
7. Warranty Disclaimer & Liability

7.1 No Warranty
The Nine Box Cognition Model is provided "as is" without warranty.
The authors are not liable for damages resulting from its use.

7.2 Indemnification
Users and developers assume full responsibility for legal and ethical compliance.
8. Amendments & Future Versions

8.1 License Evolution
This license may be updated in the future to enhance ethical protections.
Users must comply with the most recent version.

8.2 Community Feedback
Open-source communities are encouraged to discuss refinements and propose ethical improvements.
9. Legal Integration with CC BY 4.0

9.1 Dual License Structure
The Nine Box Ethical Open-Source License (NBEOSL) works in conjunction with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).
This ensures that the Nine Box Cognition Model remains open-source and freely available while enforcing ethical considerations for AI development.

9.2 What This Means in Practice

    The Nine Box Cognition Model remains open and accessible for modification and distribution.
    Users must attribute the original work to João Lucas Meira Costa.
    This license operates alongside CC BY 4.0. While CC BY 4.0 governs usage and attribution, NBEOSL applies specifically to AI implementations developed with the Nine Box Cognition Model, ensuring ethical protections.
