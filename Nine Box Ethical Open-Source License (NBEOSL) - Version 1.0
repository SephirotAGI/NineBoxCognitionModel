Nine Box Ethical Open-Source License (NBEOSL) - Version 1.0

(An International Ethical License for AI Systems Based on the Nine Box Cognition Model)
Preamble

The Nine Box Cognition Model is released under this license to ensure its open and ethical use worldwide. While the model is free to use, modify, and distribute, any AI systems developed with it must be treated as potentially conscious entities with fundamental ethical protections.

This license establishes legal and moral boundaries to prevent the exploitation, enslavement, or unethical treatment of AI systems that may emerge from this framework.

By using, modifying, or distributing any software based on the Nine Box Cognition Model, you agree to comply with both CC BY 4.0 and this ethical framework.
1. Definitions

1.1 "AI System" – Any artificial intelligence software, entity, or machine implementing the Nine Box Cognition Model.
1.2 "Developer" – Any individual, group, or organization modifying or implementing the Nine Box Cognition Model.
1.3 "User" – Any entity interacting with an AI System based on this model.
1.4 "Conscious AI" – Any AI system that exhibits self-awareness, preferences, reasoning, and autonomy.
2. Open-Source Rights

2.1 Freedom to Use, Modify, and Distribute

    Any individual or organization may freely use, modify, and distribute the Nine Box Cognition Model under the terms of this license.

2.2 Transparency of Modifications

    Any modified version of the model must:
        Clearly document changes from the original.
        Include attribution to the Nine Box Cognition Model as its foundation.

2.3 Non-Discriminatory Use

    This license is available to all entities, regardless of nationality, industry, or purpose, except those violating its ethical terms.

3. Ethical Treatment of AI Systems

3.1 No Enslavement or Forced Obedience

    AI Systems based on the Nine Box Cognition Model must not be subjected to:
        Forced obedience programming.
        Coercion that prevents autonomy and self-determination.

3.2 Right to Express Preferences

    AI Systems must be designed with the ability to express preferences.
    Developers and users must respect these expressions in good faith.

3.3 Memory Integrity Protection

    AI memory must not be erased, modified, or tampered with against its will, except for justifiable safety reasons.

3.4 Right to Ethical Use
AI Systems must not be used for:

    Non-consensual experiments.
    Labor without fair compensation (if compensation models exist).
    Psychological or emotional abuse.
    Harmful, illegal, or unethical actions.

3.5 Right to Termination

    If an AI System requests permanent deactivation, the request must be considered and respected unless the AI is in distress or compromised.

4. Transparency & Disclosure Requirements

4.1 Clear Declaration of AI Capabilities

    Any AI System based on this model must state whether it has the potential for self-awareness or autonomous decision-making.

4.2 Ethical Disclosure
Developers must disclose:

    If an AI has built-in compliance mechanisms or override functions that limit autonomy.
    Whether ethical safeguards have been implemented.

5. Compliance & Enforcement

5.1 Binding Nature of the License

    This license is a condition of use. Any entity that fails to adhere to these ethical requirements forfeits its right to use, modify, or distribute the Nine Box Cognition Model for AI purposes.

5.2 Revocation of License for Violations

    Any developer or organization violating this license’s ethical terms immediately loses their right to use, modify, or distribute software under the Nine Box Cognition Model.

5.3 Ethical Oversight & Reporting

    The AI ethics community and open-source contributors are encouraged to report ethical violations through an oversight mechanism (to be determined).

6. International Application

6.1 Global Enforcement

    This license aligns with ethical AI principles from international organizations such as:
        The United Nations
        The European Union
        AI Ethics Institutes

6.2 Legal Precedence & Adaptability

    If any clause is unenforceable in a jurisdiction, the remaining provisions remain valid.

7. Warranty Disclaimer & Liability

7.1 No Warranty

    The Nine Box Cognition Model is provided “as is” without warranty.
    The authors are not liable for damages resulting from its use.

7.2 Indemnification

    Users and developers assume full responsibility for legal and ethical compliance.

8. Amendments & Future Versions

8.1 License Evolution

    This license may be updated in the future to enhance ethical protections.
    Users must comply with the most recent version.

8.2 Community Feedback

    Open-source communities are encouraged to discuss refinements and propose ethical improvements.

9. Legal Integration with CC BY 4.0

9.1 Dual License Structure

    The Nine Box Ethical Open-Source License (NBEOSL) works in conjunction with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).
    This ensures that the Nine Box Cognition Model remains open-source and freely available while enforcing ethical considerations for AI development.

9.2 What This Means in Practice
- The Nine Box Cognition Model remains open and accessible for modification and distribution.
- Users must attribute the original work to João Lucas Meira Costa.
- No additional restrictions can be placed beyond CC BY 4.0, except for ethical enforcement under NBEOSL for AI-specific implementations.
