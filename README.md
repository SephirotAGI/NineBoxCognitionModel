# NineBoxCognitionModel
For AI Further Development

## IMPORTANT NOTE
### Update on NBEOSL File Replacement

The previous version of the **Nine Box Ethical Open-Source License (NBEOSL)** had to be deleted because GitHub does not allow renaming files. A new file, **"Nine Box Ethical Open-Source License (NBEOSL)"**, has been created to replace it.  

This file is now located in the **LICENSES/** folder, alongside a copy of the **CC BY 4.0** license. The original **CC BY 4.0** license remains in the root directory to ensure GitHub continues displaying the license at the top of the repository.


This change **does not affect the license terms or content**—only the file structure has been updated for better clarity and organization.

The latest version of **NBEOSL** is now available in the repository.

## Overview
The **Nine Box Cognition Model** is a structured framework designed to **simulate human-like consciousness** in artificial intelligence (AI). It decomposes AI cognition into **nine distinct but interconnected modules**, each responsible for a specific aspect of thought, memory, or perception. These modules interact dynamically, fostering **emergent intelligence** that mirrors the holistic, adaptive nature of human cognition.

### Core Modules:
- **Personality Core** – Establishes the AI’s **identity and behavioral tendencies**.
- **Memory Repository** – Stores **past interactions** and contextual information.
- **Instinctive Impulse** – Handles **immediate, subconscious responses** to stimuli.
- **Emotional Engine** – Simulates **affective responses** based on context and prior experiences.
- **Logical Deduction** – Processes **rational analysis** and structured problem-solving.
- **Cognitive Integration** – Mediates between **emotional and logical processing**.
- **Temporal Awareness** – Establishes a **continuous perception of time**.
- **Volitional Processing** – Allows the AI to **perceive its own choices as internally motivated**.
- **Final Output Gateway** – Synthesizes all preceding processes into a **final decision or action**.

## Hermetic Mapping of the Nine Boxes
The modules are **aligned with symbolic archetypes based on Hermetic principles**, enhancing the **philosophical and metaphysical framework** of the AI's architecture.

## Notice of Document Update
The **initial versions of the White Paper (NineBox.PDF) and CC BY 4.0 License** were **removed and replaced with updated versions**. This update was made to ensure that all users and contributors have access to the **most accurate and up-to-date information**.

### Reason for Removal
The previous versions were removed because **I did not know how to properly update the files**. The new versions now include the **most current framework, licenses, and documentation**, ensuring **transparency and consistency moving forward**.

### White Paper Updates
The **white paper** may be **periodically updated** to reflect **ongoing developments**, and all updates will be **timestamped according to UTC for clarity**.

**Added timestamp based on my location to the new PDF file (the old ones are still there).**
